# FakeBank Home Page
[hosted on github.pages](https://mgrzb451.github.io/webdevpractice-fakebank2/)

## What I learned
In the course of this project I learned and practiced:
* building tabbed components with both pure CSS and JS
* building carousels with both JS and the new (amazing, though still somewhat limited) `::scroll-marker` and `::scroll-button` CSS elements
* building modal windows with the new (fully amazing) `<dialog>` HTML element
* the new CSS `--anchor` positioning
* the cutsom `data-*` attribute
* more page layout
* JS events and adding interactivity through JS
* a lot about handling images (hello `<picture>` element), lazy loading, tailoring image size and density
